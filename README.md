# F# fullstack concept ðŸ¦Ž

There is no doubts that F# is a great language, which is surrounded by awesome OSS community. But how much commercial F# projects you could name? Well, yeah...

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate, that F# can be used in enterprise environment. And not just "can", but is much more appealing for developers than C#.

It is planned to implement fullstack product, consisting of:
 - Frontend SPA
 - Backend API (split into layers - domain, application, persistence, web service)
 - Database

The idea is to write frontend and backend with F#, using something like SAFE stack.
